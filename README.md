# Visualizing Movie Flops

### Introduction
It is a common misconception that a film being 'bad' is the reason why it becomes a flop. We explored different factors such as genre and release month and found there are other factors which can drive a film to underperform.

This project is a visual exploration of film 'flops'. We define a box-office flop (or bomb) to be a film that doesn't make back its budget. Data manipulation was done using pandas in Python 3, visualization were created using ggplot and the python extension [rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We were able to do this analysis using [The Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) off Kaggle by user Rounak Banik.

### Overview (how to read this repo)
1. Download the [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
2. Install [rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
3. Run the [data manipulations notebook](https://github.com/njparker1993/movie_visualization/blob/master/dataset_wide_data_manipulations.ipynb) to genreate merged and cleaned datasets
4. Run the [combined visualization notebook](https://github.com/njparker1993/movie_visualization/blob/master/final_combined_notebooks.ipynb) to generate the plots
5. Our final visualizations and narrative can be seen in a [pdf slideshow](https://github.com/njparker1993/movie_visualization/blob/master/Visualization_Presentation.pdf) we created and presented at the University of San Francisco
